## About Me

I'm a flexible, willing learner who thrives in a social work environment. I place emphasis on ensuring colleagues, customers, patients, visitors, and others feel heard and well taken care of. This is an important part of my professional and personal philosophy.

I'm passionate about using technology to improve efficiency, both in my personal and professional life. My skills in Python, HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL have enabled me to automate tasks, such as generating user account settings from Excel lists. This has not only saved time but also increased my understanding of database structures. This skill allows me to streamline processes and improve workflows.
